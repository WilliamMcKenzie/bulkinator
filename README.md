## Purpose
Bulkinator was a designed as a simple meal planner/searcher app, where you can say what macros you want and it fills out the days 3 meals. It was inspired by my personal fitness, as I was on "The Bulk" at the time (meaning I was trying to gain muscle fast by eating a lot). It turned out to be more of a funny website then practical, as people in my school found meals like dogfood and pictures of chefs.
